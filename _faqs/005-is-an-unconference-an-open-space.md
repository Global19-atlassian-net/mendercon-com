question: "Is an unconference the same as an Open Space?"
---

We didn’t call MenderCon an Open Space, because we're not strictly following the rules for an event that bears that 
description. There is a vibrant community that’s really passionate about Open Space events, and the people in that 
community take pride in making sure that Open Space events are done right. During planning for MenderCon, we made a few decisions 
about the schedule that don't fit the full spirit of an Open Space event, specifically, 
kicking the event off with a keynote and having dedicated networking time. If we were to follow the Open Space format 
strictly, then the keynote and networking time would be sessions like any others.
