question: "What do I do if I want to speak? Is there a CFP?"
---

There is no CFP. If you want to speak, make sure you come to the “pitch session”. At the pitch session we’ll invite 
anyone who wants to organize a session up onto the virtual stage. There, they’ll briefly announce their session title 
along with a short description and the time that the session is scheduled to happen.
